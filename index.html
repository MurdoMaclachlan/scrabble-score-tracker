      Scrabble Score Tracker (Version 0.3 Beta)

    <p class="para">
      This is a small project that tracks the score of a game of Scrabble. Made for an Advanced Higher Computing project. I actually started it way back in March, originally as just a hobby, but most of the main work has been done since I decided to use it for my Advanced Higher project.

      this may be redundant, kept just in case.

      completely removed brython module, as it seems it would require all the python to be in the html page
